                <h2>On the Subject of That's The Badger</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Failure to fail.</p>

                <p>This module presents a deck of cards atop a badger icon. Upon solving most other modules, some of a game of KTANE Mao will occur. KTANE Mao has a set of standard rules; however, one other rule will have been added.<br />
                When you are confident in the rules of the game, press the badger icon. This will enter gameplay mode. During gameplay mode, use the left and right arrow buttons to select cards, and the badger icon to play your selected card. Use the down arrow button to draw a card and say "pass." Use the fox icon button to toggle whether you will say "That's the Fox" after playing your next card. Sucessfully play seven cards to defuse the module.</p>

                <h3>Clarifications</h3>
                <p>The deck consists of 10 standard 52 card decks shuffled together. At the start of the game, each player will draw 5 cards, then one card will be dealt into the play pile.</p>
                <p>If the fox icon is large, you will say "That's the Fox" upon playing your next card.</p>
                <p>Pressing any button will reset the timer if it is your turn to play.</p>
                <p>Any player may speak in any voice at any time.</p>
                <p>A rule can use the following information:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The card played,</li>
                    <li>The previous card played,</li>
                    <li>The number of cards in the deck,</li>
                    <li>The number of cards in the play pile,</li>
                    <li>A specific card chosen for the rule,</li>
                    <li>The number of cards in a player's hand.</li>
                </ul>
